such as health, temperature, power-on hours and more, by simply clicking on the drives name in the drives monitor.

### Missing something ?
Feel free to create a feature request if you think something would improve your handling of the app.<br/>
Your proposal will be considered and analysed to verify if an implementation is possible.<br/>
Please note that an exact timeframe for a feature cannot be provided.

## Requirements

#### All platforms
- .NET 8 Desktop Runtime<br/>

#### Windows 10+
- [PawnIO](https://pawnio.eu/) (Kernel Driver) - source available on [github](https://github.com/namazso/PawnIO)

## Where can I download it ?
You can download the latest release [from here.](https://github.com/Blacktempel/LibreDiagnostics/releases)

## Updating the app

#### Auto update
If enabled, the application will check for an update upon starting, download and apply it.<br/>
Using the update feature WILL erase all files inside of the directory where this application resides.<br/>
Please be aware of that and don't save anything else beside the application itself in its directory.<br/>
Your config file is saved elsewhere and will not be affected.<br/>
The update will be downloaded directly from the latest release on Github.<br/>
If Github has an issue or is down, the update cannot be downloaded and applied.

#### Manual update
You can also update manually by selecting the update button when opening the menu (right click) on the tray icon in your taskbar.<br/>
The update process will be the same as explained in auto update.<br/>
Downloading the latest release from Github and manually replacing it is also perfectly fine.

## What platforms are supported ?
All of our code is cross-platform and also builds on Linux.<br/>
So far only Windows has been tested, so Linux support is experimental.<br/>
Not all settings and features may be available on other operating systems.

## Supported languages
- English
- German / Deutsch

Feel free to contribute translations for other languages !

## Reporting issues
LibreDiagnostics is using existing hardware monitoring libraries and drivers.<br/>
Any issues regarding hardware access (like invalid sensor values) should be reported to the respective project.<br/>
If you find bugs or issues in LibreDiagnostics itself, please open an issue on the repository.

### Used libraries and projects
- https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor

#### Verifying sensor issues with LibreHardwareMonitor
You can verify if a sensor issue is related to LibreDiagnostics or LibreHardwareMonitor by using the user interface of LibreHardwareMonitor.<br/>
A good verification step is to check if the same sensor shows the same issue in both applications.<br/>
Please remember that the latest release of LibreHardwareMonitor may be different than the version used in LibreDiagnostics.<br/>
To have a better comparison, you can download Artifacts of a recent master build from ["Actions" on the LibreHardwareMonitor repository](https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor/actions) and test with that.

## FAQ
**Q:** Where can I find my config file ?<br/>
**A:** The config file is located in your local application data folder.<br/>
For Windows this would be at: ``%LocalAppData%/LibreDiagnostics/Settings.json``.<br/>

## How can I help improve the project ?
Feel free to give feedback and contribute to our project !<br/>
Pull requests are welcome. Please include as much information as possible.

## Administrator rights

#### Windows
Some functionality requires administrator privileges to access the data.<br/>
This includes, but is not limited to, Kernel drivers and therefore specific calls to `DeviceIoControl`.<br/>
If forcing the software to start without appropiate rights, functionality may be limited or not work at all.
